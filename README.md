# StockExchange (rebootstockexchange)

A portfolio project

## Install the dependencies
```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
quasar dev
```

### Limitations
1. There are two stocks in particular are excluded from the game. One of them being Alphabet . It is sort of redudant to Alphabet - Class A. The other one being Meta something. No price data came back even when request was made correctly and came back with a 200 sucess status. As I am on the free plan, there was no technical support from the API side. To keep the game running, it's excluded from the game data.
